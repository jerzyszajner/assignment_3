# JavaScript Quiz - Individual Assignment 3

This project was developed as part of Individual Assignment 3 for the **Frontend Development (FFU1100)** module during Semester 1. The primary goal was to create an interactive quiz application using fundamental JavaScript concepts.

## Brief Description

This project is an interactive quiz application developed as part of **Individual Assignment 3** for the **Frontend Development (FFU1100)** course. The goal was to apply JavaScript fundamentals, such as variables, conditionals, loops, and DOM manipulation.

### During the project:

- I started by creating the HTML structure for the start screen, question section, and results section. To visualize the answers early in development, I initially hardcoded placeholder buttons in the HTML structure for testing.
- CSS was used with Flexbox and media queries to ensure responsiveness across different devices.
- The biggest challenge was implementing the JavaScript logic to dynamically manage questions and answers, especially handling answer selection and storing incorrect answers for the review section.
- I faced challenges in selecting and displaying incorrect answers in the review section. To solve this, I used GPT to refine the logic and ensure it worked as intended.
- Another challenge was designing a clear and functional review section, which required processing data in arrays and dynamically manipulating the DOM.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Questions:** 10 JavaScript-related questions displayed one at a time.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktops and mobile devices.
- **Answer Review:** Review incorrect answers at the end of the quiz.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Hover effects, styled alerts, and dynamic progress tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Semantic structure for quiz components.
- **CSS**: Responsive layout with Flexbox and Media Queries.
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, event handling, and data-driven logic.
